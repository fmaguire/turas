Turas
-----

Turas is a tool to identify the ideal location for a meeting/conference
on the criteria of minimal travel distance for all participants.  


Implementation
==============

- Take in list of delegate starting locations

- Find the nearest N airports to the weighted geographic mid-point

- Query some form of flight API (still not sure) for all the starting locations
and the set of N airports near midpoint
